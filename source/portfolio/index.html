<p><br><center><h2>Posterous Safari Extension</h2></center>

<p><center><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22370970/Posterous.safariextz"> <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22370970/blogimages/safari_posterous_extension.png"></a></center>

<center><p>Being a fan of the Posterous platform and a Mac user, I thought I would take time out to develop a Safari Extension of my own.</p>

<p>I’ve wrapped up the official Posterous bookmarklet in to a Safari toolbar item, all the functionality of the brilliant bookmarklet remains but having a neat little toolbar icon seems just that little bit more elegant.
If you would like to use it for yourself then you can download it from <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22370970/Posterous.safariextz">here</a>.</p></center>
