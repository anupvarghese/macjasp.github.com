### About This Site
This site is a "baked blog" running on the quite lovely [Octopress](http://octopres.org) and hosted for free using the equally adorable [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

Images are hosted via Dropbox, Evernote or Flickr.

The theme is my own modification of the [Slash theme](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/) with the Proxima Nova font provided for free by [Typekit](http://typekit.com).

All content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com) on one of an iPhone, iPad Mini or MacBook Pro {% fn_ref 1 %}.

### Hacks & Plugins
Changes I've made to date are;

- Remove the /blog/subdirectory and date from the permalink path, going with a cleaner domain/post-title format (I'm undecided however on whether I should keep comments enabled against posts, it feels better without them but currently I'm keeping them enabled).

- Installed Felipe Cyprianoâ€™s [Footnotes plugin](https://github.com/fmcypriano/footnote-octopress).

- Installed Scott W. Bradley's [Tweet Tag](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag).

### About Me
I'm an IT Consultant, self confessed tech geek and when I can be bothered to, an occasional developer in iOS and web technologies.

I have a passion for minimalistic, elegant design, I listen to [melancholic / kitchen sink music](http://last.fm/user/macjasp) endlessly, [carry a camera with me everywhere](http://www.flickr.com/photos/-macjasp/) and when the mood suits, I run.
