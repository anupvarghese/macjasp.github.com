### About this Site (Content)
This site will focus primarily on photography occasionally interspersed with pieces of code and other technical ramblings. 
### About this Site (Technical)
This site is a "baked blog" running on the quite lovely [Octopress](http://octopres.org) with content generated on a [Raspberry Pi](http:raspberrypi.org) and hosted on the equally adorable [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Images are hosted via Dropbox and Flickr.

The theme is my own modification of the [Slash theme](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/) with the Proxima Nova font provided for free by [Typekit](http://typekit.com).

All content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com).

### Hacks & Plugins
Changes I've made to date are;

- Removed the /blog/ subdirectory and date from the permalink path, going with a cleaner domain/post-title format.

- Installed Felipe Cyprianoâ€™s [Footnotes plugin](https://github.com/fmcypriano/footnote-octopress).

- Installed Scott W. Bradley's [Tweet Tag](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag).

- Installed [my own forked version](https://github.com/macjasp/jekyll_flickr_set_tag) of [tsmango's Flickr Set Plugin](https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_flickr_set_tag)

### About Me
I'm an IT Consultant, self confessed tech geek and when I can be bothered to, an occasional developer in iOS and web technologies.

I have a passion for minimalistic, elegant design. I listen to [melancholic / kitchen sink music](http://last.fm/user/macjasp) endlessly, [carry a camera with me everywhere](http://www.flickr.com/photos/-macjasp/) and when the mood suits, I run.
