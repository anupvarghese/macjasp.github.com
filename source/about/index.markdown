### About This Site
This site is a "baked blog" running on the quite lovely [Octopress](http://octopres.org) and hosted for free using the equally adorable [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).

All content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com) on one of an iPhone, iPad Mini or MacBook Pro (depending on location).

This site is likely to forever be in beta while I tinker and tune the Octopress theme to my liking.

### About Me
I'm an IT Consultant, self confessed tech geek and when I can be bothered to, an occasional developer in such technologies as iOS, HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS & Python.

I have a passion for minimalistic, elegant design, I listen to [melancholic / kitchen sink music](http://last.fm/user/macjasp) endlessly, [carry a camera with me everywhere](http://www.flickr.com/photos/-macjasp/) and when the mood suits, I run.
